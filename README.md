## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand technical details</strong></summary>

### Real-Time Code Collaboration Flow

- When a user types or changes code, the update is sent instantly via WebSocket to the server.
- The server broadcasts the code change to all other users connected in the same room, keeping everyone‚Äôs editor in sync.

### Unique Room ID Generation

- Each collaboration session is identified by a unique room ID.
- This ID is generated using the `uuid` library to ensure it is globally unique and unpredictable.
- Users create or join a room by sharing this room ID, enabling isolated real-time collaboration spaces.

### Real-Time Chat Messaging

- Users can communicate instantly through a chat feature integrated alongside the code editor.
- Chat messages are sent and received via the same WebSocket connection, allowing seamless real-time interaction.

### AI Code Generation (Copilot-style Feature)

- Users can request AI-generated code suggestions or completions.
- This feature connects to an AI backend that processes prompts and returns generated code snippets, enhancing productivity.

### Interactive Whiteboard

- A shared whiteboard allows users to brainstorm, sketch ideas, and plan collaboratively in real-time.
- All whiteboard interactions such as drawing or erasing are synced across connected users instantly.

### User Presence and Layout Management

- The system tracks and displays which users are currently active in the room.
- Users can switch between different layouts to customize their workspace, for example toggling between editor-only, whiteboard-only, or split-screen views.
